# Color palette extraction

With an emphasis on 
- **Accuracy**, using a clustering algorithm and saliency feature detection to find the most representative colors.
  *Other libraries use a simple histogram and manual thresholding / quantization*
- **Usability**, by returning colors that are visually distinct and can be used in a design.
  *Other libraries return "just the main colors", we also look for contrast and accents*
- **Speed**, by using worker threads and array buffers.
  *Other libraries are synchronous and require a lot of memory to run*


```ts
const colors = await extractColors(buffer, 3, {
	workers: true,
	colorSpace: oklabSpace,
	strategy: gapStatisticKmeans({ max: 10 }),
	clamp: 0.005,
})
```

## Multi-threading

A lot of the work done by this library is CPU intensive, so if performance is *at all* a concern, you should enable multithreading by using the `workers: true` option. If [`piscina`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/piscina) is installed, it will be used to manage the worker pool, and the pool can be provided (`worker: pool`) to integrate with the rest of your application

## Unit-testing colors

Because changes on "color manipulation" algorithms can be chaotic, we need to be able to test our resulting colors with some form of *fuzzy matching*. Additionally, color codes don't immediately mentally map to actual colors, making tests hard to read.

For this we base our tests on "named colors" (taken from the CSS list):
```ts
t.diagnostic(`accent: ${hex(accent)} >> ${nameColor(accent)} (${simpleColor(accent)})`)
assert.strictEqual(nameColor(accent), 'lightcoral')
// will output: â„¹ accent: #f85963 >> lightcoral (salmon)
```
